# Get_next_line

This project consist of writing a function get_next_line which get the next line
in a file.
There are some features this function must implement:

we only use libft.
we need to implement a buffer. We can't come back in the file descriptor. We can't move in the
file descriptor. We can only use read, free, malloc. No call to lseek.
we can't use global variable.
we can't use FILE structure. We need to create one.
we can read multiple file descriptors at the same time (which implies a
buffer).
we can't have memory leaks: every malloc must be freed.
the buffer size (use by read) can be changed.
